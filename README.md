This python script is designed to analze a websites source code and identify the vulnerabilities it may be prone to. It will produce a resport in text format that will be saved in a folder it creates called bugbounty reprts. this folder will be created in the same directory the script is ran from. the file will be saved in txt format. When it asks for the websites URL you must enter https:// with the www.nameofthesite.com or else it will not work. I do need to mae adjustments to the code to correct that but until then enjoy my creation its my first real code. By the way my name is jason muniz and i grant the lcense to use this safely and responsibly on the web please do not use it unethically if you do then you are bound to the legal ramifications not me becuase i didnot design this code to assist malicious hackers but to help peope make securer website and a safer internet. under gpl3.0 i grant opensource use. signing off lefty a.k.a jason muniz
